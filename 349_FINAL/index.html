                <p>Increasingly we're seeing promises of AI as the future, and more cross-sector implementation of AI-powered technologies. Corporations compete for a technological edge and the title of "Smart". These ideas of smartness and infrastructure are culturally situated within Enlightenment notions of progress and innovation. Technology in reality is more diverse than this: smartness is not an anthropomorphized robot.

                <p class="slide-right show-on-scroll">Sustaining the AI industry involves a vast, global supply chain which includes resource extraction for minerals such as lithium and cobalt from the global south, water to cool data centers, energy to power servers, and land for this infrastructure to inhabit. This involves displacing groups of people, stealing resources from them, and even creating a neo-colonial dynamic between countries which own infrastructure and those which have been historically exploited.</p>
