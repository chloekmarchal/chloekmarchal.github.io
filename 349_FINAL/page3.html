            <p>AI, as we, a non-expert public understand it, is only visible when it is desirable. AI has been a part of the digital landscape for years already,
                but it is marketed and repackaged by corporations as something novel, because they have a service and a
                product to sell.</p>

            What are the cultural politics embedded in invisibility?

        <article class="explain2 slide-left show-on-scroll">
            <p>It is Big Tech’s best interest to downplay them, so that resource extraction can continue. By choosing to represent AI and the broader computing industry as immaterial and virtual, we are led to believe that our online actions have no material consequences. 
                Thus, while corporations claim transparency with users and the public, the optics are always distorted somehow, to the corporation’s benefit. Less visibility means less accountability for corporations, leading to less regulation and enforcement of said regulation.</p>

            <p>The AI industry relies on “black-boxing”, making AI inaccessible to those who are not industry experts,
                researchers, or management. Black-boxing is a term from engineering and computer science which means
                that internal operations are concealed, and only input and outputs are visible.</p>
